# TicTacTi
Ever wanted to play tic-tac-toe on a TI calculator? I'm sure someone else has done it, but here it is anyway.

This is my first shot at a full-blown TI-83 - 84 Program. I've made simple Ti Basix programs in the past, for factoring numbers and vector calculations and such, but nothing that constituted a fully complete program.

The game is simple. At the start of the game you are randomly chosen as X's or O's and use a selstor to place your symbols, playing against a basic AI.

The source code of this project is a total mess, mostly because of the limitations of the language and my inexperience with it (writing a whole program without a single function? BLASPHEMY.) but for the most part it works. I have noticied one bug involving the game hanging once the tic-tac-toe game finishes.

I wrote alot of comments in the source to keep track of everything (TI Basic formatting is HORRID), so some of it may make sense.
